# Mission-to-Mars

## Project Overview
The project consisted of writing a Python script to scrape information about the mission to Mars from the web and display it in a single webpage. The Flask web app scrapes new data and stores it in a noSQL database: MongoDB, since the information downloaded won't be limited to tables, but also paragraphs and images.
